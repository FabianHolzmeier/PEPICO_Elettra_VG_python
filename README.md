# PEPICO_Elettra_VG_python
Python code for analyzing electron-ion coincidence experiments conducted at the GasPhase beamline of Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste using the VG electron analyzer.

Coincidence events of the raw data files corresponding to the same kinetic energy are analyzed with "main.py" which uses the four classes "VG_tof", "VG_Tof_only", "VG_Movie_Tof", and "VG_figures".

The final PEPICO matrix can then be obtained using the script "PEPICO_complete_sp.py".

A mini-manual is provided in "PEPICO_Elettra_VG.pdf"
